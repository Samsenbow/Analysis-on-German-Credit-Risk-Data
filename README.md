**Reasons for selecting German Credit Risk data**

~1000 observations, 20 features → manageable.

Binary target: good vs. bad credit risk.

Contains both numerical (age, duration, amount) and categorical (housing, job, purpose) features → can practice handling real-world style data.

Well-documented and widely used, so if I get stuck, examples exist online.
